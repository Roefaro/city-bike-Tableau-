2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure consistency in the data columns and formats, especially for date and time fields.

### Data Analysis
1. **Aggregation**: Merge multiple datasets, if necessary, ensuring data consistency.
2. **Visualization**: Use Tableau to design 2-5 visualizations for each of the two phenomena you discover (4-10 total visualizations).

### Questions to Consider

   - **Basic**: Static map with popular start and end stations, overlaid with zip code data.
   - **Advanced**: Dynamic map showing monthly and yearly popularity changes, overlaid with zip code data.
2. **Dashboards**: Create dashboards to display your visualizations and support your analysis.

### Final Presentation
1. **Tableau Story**: Compile your visualizations, dashboards, and maps into a cohesive Tableau story.
2. **Professional Presentation**: Ensure your presentation is logical, visually appealing, and easy to understand for city officials.
