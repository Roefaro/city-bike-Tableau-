# New York Citi Bike Data Analysis

## Overview

In my role as the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I undertook a comprehensive data analysis project to generate insights and reports for city officials. The project aimed to answer key questions about the program's utilization and identify unexpected phenomena using data visualization techniques.

## Project Files

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** 
  - `part_1_mars_news.ipynb` (Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News)
  - `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb` (Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data)
- **Data Sources:** Downloaded from [Citi Bike Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)

## Instructions Followed

### Before Beginning

1. **Created a Tableau Public Account:** I saved all my work to Tableau Public as the free tier only allows saving to their public server.
2. **Selected Data Files:** I carefully chose 1-3 zip files from the Citi Bike Data page, ensuring they were from the same period to maintain consistency.

### Analysis and Visualization

I aggregated the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and identified two unexpected phenomena. For each phenomenon, I designed multiple visualizations, created dashboards, and provided analysis to explain the findings.

#### Questions Addressed

- How many trips were recorded in total during the chosen period?
- By what percentage has total ridership grown?
- How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
- What are the peak hours when bikes are used during different seasons?
- Which stations are the most and least popular for starting and ending journeys?
- How does the average trip duration vary by user type?
- What is the average distance of a bike trip?
- Which bikes are most likely due for repair or inspection?

### Visualizations

I created 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon, resulting in 4–10 total visualizations. The visualizations were used to design dashboards accompanied by analysis explaining the observed phenomena. 

### Mapping

I developed a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) with zip code data overlaid. This map is accompanied by a write-up describing observed trends.

### Final Presentation

I created a Tableau story to bring together the visualizations, maps, and dashboards. The story is designed to be professional, logical, and visually appealing, ensuring it effectively communicates the findings to city officials and public administrators.

## Results

### Insights

1. **Phenomenon 1:** (Describe the first unexpected phenomenon you discovered)
   - **Visualizations:** (List the types of visualizations created, e.g., bar charts, line graphs)
   - **Analysis:** (Summarize the analysis provided)

2. **Phenomenon 2:** (Describe the second unexpected phenomenon you discovered)
   - **Visualizations:** (List the types of visualizations created)
   - **Analysis:** (Summarize the analysis provided)

### Maps

- **Dynamic Map:** Shows how each station's popularity changes over time, overlaid with zip code data.
  - **Trends:** (Describe any trends or patterns noticed)

## Conclusion

This project was an opportunity to demonstrate my skills in data aggregation, analysis, and visualization using Tableau. The insights gained from this analysis can help inform programmatic changes and improvements for the Citi Bike program.

## Resources

- **Class Assignments:** Previous assignments and projects completed during my coursework.
- **StackOverflow:** Community-driven support for troubleshooting and enhancing my code.
- **Documentation:** Official documentation for Tableau, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, and other tools used in the project.
